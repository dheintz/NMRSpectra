#  I am struggling in defining precisely what an NMR spectrum is.
#  Much of this work will be defining the resources and properties
#    while dancing about the issue of what an NMR spectrum really is.
#  Whenever possible, insights will be documented.
#  There will likely be the potential for confusion as seemingly similar concepts
#    will have different properties and need different names.
#
#  Broad attempt 1 at NMR spectrum:
#    When a particular sample (defined by its contents and conditions), is placed inside
#    a particular spectrometer (scientific instrument with certain properties - most important field strength),
#    and particular pulsed experiments are applied (abstraction of electronic process) - the nuclei will emit rf signals.
#    This emission is a characteristic property of the combination: sample-spectrometer-experiment.
#    ** I'm dancing about the issue of uniqueness here **
#    ** For one thing, there is noise.  So two identical sample-spec-experiment events will differ at least by noise.
#    ** From another perspective, how different must the sample's contents / conditions be to be different?
#    **   Can you walk into the same river twice?
#    **   The scientist assumes that small variations in sample-spec-experiment conditions will not produce
#    **     significant variation and therefore all experiments can be grouped and used for generalization.
#    **   This may need to be treated like distinction between Honda Civic as type of car and the blue
#    **     Honda Civic with a broken timing chain on the side of the Garden State Parkway on Dec 11, 1989.
#
#  Another viewpoint of the NMR spectrum is that it is an event.
#  At a particular point in space-time a scientist inserts the sample, applies the pulsed experiment,
#    and the spectrometer records the emission over a certain duration. (seconds to days.) 
#  The emission is analog, but the spectrometer quickly digitizes the signal, down-samples it and 
#    stores the numerical representation in a digital file.  There will be many digital copies of the file.
#  The various ways of storing numbers and ordering of points in a data stream will complicate things.
#    My first pass at the identity condition is that any equivalent digital representation of the same
#    "event" is the same NMR spectrum.

# myNMRSpectrum is a generalized instance of such a recording of the NMR spectrum.

# It's getting a bit late on the due date.  In reviewing the part-whole literature, I think
#   Signals -> Spectrum is a membership relationship, because an individual NMRSignal can be part of many NMRSpectra.
#   **  This harkens back to earlier description that a given sample-spec-experiment generates an NMRSpectrum
#   **  If the sample-spec are the same, but the experiment is different, the same signal can be in 2 spectra.
#   **  Just as Michael Gryk can be a member of GSLIS and AAA, signals are members of spectra.

# Nucleus to protein is tricky.  In one sense, it is a component, like the handle of a cup.  However, if certain nuclei
#   are removed they change the character of the larger object.  If I remove one leg from a chair, I have a chair with a
#   missing leg.  If I remove all four legs, I don't have a chair any more.  If certain nuclei are removed, the protein
#   would break into pieces and completely change it's character.
